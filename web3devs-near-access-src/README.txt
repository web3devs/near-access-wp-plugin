Limit access to Posts and Pages based on user's [NEAR](https://www.near.co/) wallet content (NFTs).

== Description ==

NEAR Access Plugin allows users to define which Posts or Pages have limited access based on user's [NEAR Wallet](https://wallet.near.org/) wallet contents (NFTs).

Ex. let's say you own Crypto Ducks Club NFTs and want your blog content to be available only to other Crypto Ducks Club owners - with this plugin, you can do that.
Depends on NEAR API at https://rpc.near.org and https://rpc.testnet.near.org (testnet) - no accounts are needed to connect.
